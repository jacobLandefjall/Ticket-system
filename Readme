Project Title: Ticket Management System
Introduction

This project is a Ticket Management System that allows users to create and manage support tickets. Agents can classify and resolve tickets, and both users and agents can comment on ticket updates. The system supports file attachments and integrates with SSO for secure login.
Architecture Overview

The system uses a Node.js backend with MySQL as the database. EJS is used for server-side templating, and Multer handles file uploads. Authentication is done using Auth0 with roles assigned to users and agents.
