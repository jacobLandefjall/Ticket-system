# Ticketing System

## Introduction
This project is a ticketing system designed to help manage and organize support tickets. The system allows users to create, categorize, and manage tickets. It also supports file uploads, comments, and categorization based on ticket content.

## Architecture Overview (optional)
The project follows a three-layer architecture:
- **Frontend**: EJS templates rendered through Express.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API endpoints and business logic.
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB for ticket and user data storage.

## Prerequisites
To set up and run the project, you need the following tools:
- **Node.js** (version 14.x or later)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **MariaDB/MySQL** (for managing the database)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)

## Step-by-step Installation and Startup

### 1. Clone the GitHub Repository

Open a terminal and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacobLandefjall/Ticket-system.git
cd Ticket-system

2. Install all necessary Node,js Dependencies.
npm install

3. Restore the Database

Create a new database in MariaDB/MySQL
Log in to your MySQL/MariaDB and create a new database for the application:
CREATE DATABASE proj;

Import the Backup File into the Database
After creating the database, import the provided backup file to set up the necessary tables and initial data:
mysql -u [your-database-username] -p -h localhost ticket_system < ticketing_system_backup.sql
Replace [your-database-username] with your MySQL/MariaDB username.
The default database name used here is ticket_system.

mysql -u dbadm -p ticket_system < ticketing_system_backup.sql

4. Start the Application
Run the following command to start the application:
npm start

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, you can manually start the server with:
node index.js

5. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:1337

You should now be able to access and interact with the ticketing system.

6.Testing
Run Tests
To run the unit and integration tests, execute the following command:
npm test

This will execute the tests located in the tests/ folder, ensuring the integrity of the systemâ€™s core functionalities.
